Phan attempts to adhere to the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) style guide. All files should use

```php
declare(strict_types=1)
```

- [Phan's ruleset.xml](https://github.com/phan/phan/blob/master/ruleset.xml) can be used with [`phpcs` and `phpcbf`](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) to adhere to the style guide.

Pull requests that come with tests are great.

Issues that come with simplified failing code are great, but don't let that stop you from submitting issues if you can't get a simple case.
